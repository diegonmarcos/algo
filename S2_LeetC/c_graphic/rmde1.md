## 4. Geometric Algorithms**

* **Convex Hull:**
    * Finding the smallest convex polygon that encloses a set of points.
    * Used in computer graphics and pattern recognition.
* **Line Segment Intersection:**
    * Determining if two line segments intersect.
    * Used in CAD and geographic information systems (GIS).
* **Closest Pair Problem:**
    * Finding the two closest points in a set of points.
* These algorithms are very important for game developement, and graphic applications.
