/**
 * This uses the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm to draw a line
 * between two points in a wireframe. The points are specified by the indices 
 * `i` and `i + x_max * density` in the `map_points` array.
 *
 * The DDA algorithm works by calculating the intermediate points between the
 * start and end points of the line, ensuring a smooth and accurate line drawing.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - map_points: An array representing the wireframe points.
 * - i: The starting index of the line in the map_points array.
 * - x_max: The maximum number of points in the x-direction.
 * - density: density factor determines spacing between points in the wireframe.
