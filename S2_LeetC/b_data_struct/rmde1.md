## 1. Sorting and Searching Algorithms (Beyond Basic Ones)**

* **Timsort:**
    * A hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on real-world data.
    * Used in Python's `sorted()` and Java's `Arrays.sort()`.
* **Radix Sort:**
    * A non-comparison sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits.
    * Efficient for certain data distributions.
* **Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Balanced BSTs:**
    * Essential for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
    * Balanced BSTs (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) guarantee logarithmic time complexity.
* **Hash Tables:**
    * Fundamental for fast key-value lookups.
    * Understanding hash functions, collision resolution (e.g., chaining, open addressing), and load factors is vital.

## 2. Graph Algorithms (Advanced)**

* **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
    * Essential for traversing graphs and trees.
    * Used in many applications, including web crawling, network analysis, and game development.
* **Topological Sort:**
    * Ordering vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on dependencies.
    * Used in task scheduling and dependency resolution.
* **Network Flow Algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp):**
    * Solving problems related to flow capacity in networks.
    * Used in resource allocation and network optimization.
* **Graph Traversal Algorithms for specific problems**
    * Traveling salesman problem approximations.
    * Clustering algorithms.

## 3. String Algorithms**

* **String Matching Algorithms (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-Moore):**
    * Efficiently finding patterns within strings.
    * Used in text editors, search engines, and bioinformatics.
* **Regular Expressions:**
    * Powerful pattern-matching language.
    * Used in text processing and data validation.
* **Trie Data Structure:**
    * Efficiently storing and searching strings with common prefixes.
    * Used in autocomplete and spell checking.

## 5. Randomized Algorithms**

* **Quickselect:**
    * Finding the k-th smallest element in an array.
    * Often used for median finding.
* **Monte Carlo Algorithms:**
    * Using random sampling to approximate solutions.
    * Used in simulations and numerical analysis.
* **Las Vegas Algorithms:**
    * Always produce the correct result, but their runtime varies.
* These algorithms are very important for large data sets.

## 6. Approximation Algorithms**

* When optimal solutions are computationally expensive, approximation algorithms provide near-optimal solutions in polynomial time.
* Used for NP-hard problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem.
